Test-File-Generator

This is bash script that you can use to generate test files(both input and output) for a given problem.

Prerequisites :

You will have to have the test generation file and the source code file ready beforehand to use this.

Usage :

Once ready, all you have to do is run the script using the command  ./script.sh  and this will run the file.
After doing this, you will need to do as the commands say and voila! Your test files will be ready in the blink of an eye!

ability:
 have much error detection ablility (to detect false filenames, overwriting a file etc...) as of now but will be added in the future.
Added the ability to erase and overwrite old directories named input and output and also fixed a bug in the output file generation loop.
